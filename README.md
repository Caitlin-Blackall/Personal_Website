# Personal Website

*IN PROGRESS - July 2023*

## Idea
To create a personal website to display my projects and also 
write blog posts about learning to code.

## Process
I used Django to create the website and Bootstrap to assist with 
the design elements.

## Learning
### New Skills

**1. Learning Django**
It was nice to learn Django after having some experience with 
building FlaskApps. It seemed to be slightly more flexible in 
the way it works and I liked seperating each model into 
different files. I found this much easier to keep track of all 
my code and track where I was up to.

**2. Using Bootstrap**
I have never used Bootstrap before but it was very easy to 
use and similar enough to CSS. It was a more flexible design 
process which was handy and I could make page layouts quickly 
and easily.

## Conclusion
